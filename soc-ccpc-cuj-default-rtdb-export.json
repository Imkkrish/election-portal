The simulation allows users to track multiple objects, a single object, or a large dominant object in real-time, with customizable features for each mode.\n\nFeatures\nMulti-Object Tracking (MOTA): Tracks multiple objects in real-time using the MultiTracker class from OpenCV, supporting unique ID assignment and accurate tracking through occlusions.\nSingle-Object Tracking (SOTA): Utilizes OpenCV’s KCF tracker to follow a single object with high precision, adapting to occlusions and fast movements.\nLarge Single Object Tracking (LSOT): Designed for large dominant objects in the frame, maintaining focus and bounding box stability, even with rapid motion.\nInteractive Bounding Box Selection: Allows users to select objects interactively in the first frame, providing flexibility in defining the tracked regions.\nReal-Time Updates: Real-time frame-by-frame object position updates, with consistent visualization of bounding boxes.\nLibraries Used\nOpenCV (cv2): Core library for computer vision tasks, used for object tracking, video processing, and interactive bounding box selection.\nsys: Assists in system control for managing video capture, ensuring a smooth exit if the video stream fails.\nInstallation\nTo run this project, install the required libraries:\n\npip install opencv-python\nUsage\nClone the repository and navigate to the project folder.\n\nRun the simulation script:\n\npython object_tracking_simulation.py\nFollow the prompts to select objects to track:\n\nFor MOTA, select multiple objects by drawing bounding boxes and confirm each by pressing 'c'.\nFor SOTA and LSOT, select a single object to track.\nUse the ESC key to exit the tracking session.\n\nFile Structure\nobject_tracking_simulation.py - Main script implementing MOTA, SOTA, and LSOT with interactive UI.\nREADME.md - Project documentation.\nRequirements\nPython 3.6+\nOpenCV 4.x\nContributing\nFeel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the functionality or fix any bugs.\n\nThis project is a practical example of using OpenCV for real-time object tracking, suitable for applications in surveillance, motion analysis, and real-world object detection tasks.\n\nPRIYANSHU VERMA\nRegistration Number: 22190503040\nCentral University of Jharkhand\nIntegrated B.Tech-M.Tech (5 years) in Computer Science and Engineering (Honors)\nSpecialization: Machine Learning and Data Science\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering\nMobile: +91 7376021218\n\n",
